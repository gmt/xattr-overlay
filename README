To add this overlay to a Gentoo system, run the following command:

layman -o https://raw.github.com/gmt/xattr-overlay/master/overlay.xml -f -a xattr

but!!! don't do it.

Upstream now has all of this functionality merged in and it is almost certainly
best to use their versions -- not only will you benefit from being on the same
code-base as upstream, but any subsequent enhancements or bugfixes I might
contribute myself will be there -- not here.  Hooray, one less fork to maintain!
