To add this overlay to a Gentoo system, run the following command:

layman -o https://raw.github.com/gmt/xattr-overlay/master/overlay.xml -f -a xattr

Note that you must have both dev-vcs/git and app-portage/layman installed on
your system for this to work.

Getting the experimental xattr-enabled portage installed requires keywording
sys-apps/portage-9999-r1.  Emerge it (make sure you got the one from this repo
and not some other) and you're done.  Prefix portage is not supported by this
overlay -- you must be on a "non-alt" gentoo.

If you're looking for a high-quality test-ebuild, give =dev-libs/mathjax-2.2
a shot, it's just incredible.

Please note that I didn't write the wrapper.  I just threw together
some scaffolding to test it out (plus, I happened to be emerge -e
@world-ing at the moment the C source was announced and was pretty sick
of waiting... :)
